## Description

Refactored the html and css code for Horiseon to improve the website's accessibility standards. Horiseon is a company that specializes in search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.

The purpose of refactoring Horiseon's code was to meet the accessibility standards and improve the long term sustainability of their code base. In addition, the improved code will make it easier for screen readers to assist the blind and the handicap to render content via audio feedback.

I refactored the webpage by replacing 'div' elements with semantically meaningful elements such as, "main, section, article, figure, and aside" to name a few. In addition, I eliminated redundant class attributes and consolidated selectors in both the html and css files. The refactoring exercise significantly improves the search engine rankings of the website and strengthens the websites accessability.
